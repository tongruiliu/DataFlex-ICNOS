#: Which end of the raw score the curriculum should finish on.
#:
#: Every pattern arranges samples along one axis that advances as training
#: progresses; `polarity` says how the raw score maps onto that axis, and it
#: exists because "high score" means opposite things for different sources.
#:
#:   higher_later   - a larger raw score is presented later. Correct for a
#:                    quality score (FineWeb-Edu, QuRating: finish on the best
#:                    data, which is the paper's G1) and also for loss used as
#:                    difficulty (finish on the hardest, i.e. easy-to-hard).
#:   higher_earlier - a larger raw score is presented earlier. Needed when the
#:                    raw number runs backwards relative to the axis, e.g. a
#:                    perplexity standing in for quality, where low is good.
#:
#: `higher_is_better` / `lower_is_better` are accepted as aliases because they
#: read naturally for quality scores.
