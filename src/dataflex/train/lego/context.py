"""Everything a stage may need, in one object.

Each family currently reaches for a different subset of an untyped `**kwargs`:
`less` wants `optimizer_state`, `delta_loss` wants `current_update_times` and
`update_times`, the mixers want `batch` / `domain_ids` / `data_collator`. When
strategies run one at a time the trainer can hand each its own bespoke dict, but
composing them needs a single object that satisfies all of them at once — and
that any future stage can read from without changing a signature.
