"""Adapters that let existing components act as pipeline stages.

Nothing here reimplements an algorithm. Each adapter wraps a component built
from the ordinary `selectors:` / `mixers:` / `reorders:` / `weighters:` bucket

sockets:

    IndexStage.apply(plan, ctx) -> plan      transforms the index list
    LossStage.weights(losses, ctx) -> tensor per-sample multipliers

That is what makes the bricks interchangeable: adding a new selector to DataFlex
